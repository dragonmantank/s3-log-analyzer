# S3 Log Analyzer
Simple ZF2 app to parse S3 logs into a MySQL DB instance for analysis.

IMPORTANT: This application permanently deletes the log files from AWS S3. This is by design because I do not want the log files to build up, costing me money for un-needed files after they are imported into the DB. Feel free to change this in your own fork if desired. Thank you.

## Installation

S3 Log Analyzer can be used directly from a GIT clone:

    git clone https://github.com/adamculp/s3-log-analyzer.git

Or S3 Log Analyzer can also be downloaded directly, then moved to a directory in a desired location.

### Composer Usage

This project already contains Composer, and requires Composer to install all dependencies and build autoload files.

    $ cd /path/to/application/root
    $ php composer.phar self-update
    $ php composer.phar install

NOTE: In the example above the commands inform Composer to update to the latest version first, then install the application dependencies.

### Database Setup

The required database schema is located within the '/data/s3log.sql' file for initial set up of the required database. First create the desired database, such as 's3logs', then import the sql file.

    $ mysql -u username -p
    mysql> CREATE database s3logs;
    mysql> exit;
    $ mysql -u username -p s3logs < /data/s3log.sql

### Set up AWS S3

In order for the application to connect to your AWS S3 bucket containing the log files you will need to:

1. Activate logging for the S3 bucket.
    * Select the bucket we want logs for, and in the properties turn on logging.
    * Generally a new/separate bucket is created to store the log files in, so the log files themselves do not get mixed with the bucket being logged.
2. Create a policy in IAM (Identity & Access Management)
    * Navigate to IAM
    * Select Policies
    * Create Policy -> Create Your Own Policy
    * Give the policy a name like 'S3Logs', a brief description to help identify the policies purpose later, and add a policy like the one below in the AIM Policy section. (Ensure to Validate the policy prior to saving, in case something has changed since this document was created.)
3. Create a user to use the new policy
    * Select Users from the left sidebar menu in IAM.
    * Click Create New Users button and provide a username.
    * Then attach the newly created policy to the user.
    * Make note of the Key and Secret to be added to the config files in a later step.

#### AIM Policy

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "Stmt13546860950928",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                    "s3:GetBucketLogging",
                    "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:PutBucketAcl",
                    "s3:PutBucketLogging",
                    "s3:PutObject",

                    "s3:PutObjectAcl"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::*"
                ]
            },
            {
                "Sid": "AllowCreateRole",
                "Action": [
                    "iam:GetUser",
                    "iam:GetRole",
                    "iam:CreateRole",
                    "iam:PutRolePolicy"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Resource": [
                    "*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

### Configuration Files

It is necessary to update 2 configuration files:

Copy '/config/autoload/bsb_flysystem.global.php.dist' to '/config/autoload/bsb_flysystem.global.php'
Copy '/config/autoload/local.php.dist' to '/config/autoload/local.php'

Alter both configuration files to contain needed credentials with your own DB and AWS credentials.

### Virtual Host Setup

Configured web server of choice to use /public as the document root of a virtual host

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot /path/to/s3-log-analyzer/public
        ServerName yourdomain.com
    
        <Directory /path/to/s3-log-analyzer/public/>
            AllowOverride ALL
            # following line needed for Apache 2.4+
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

NOTE: The example above is to give a starting point. It may not be recommended to set AllowOverride to ALL.
